This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"Large Language Models as End-to-end Combinatorial Optimization Solvers"** presented at The Thirty-ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

## 📖 Abstract

This work explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as end-to-end solvers for combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate how LLMs can be effectively applied to solve complex optimization challenges without requiring specialized algorithmic knowledge or domain-specific heuristics.
